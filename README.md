Introduction: 
•Migraines, a exhausting neurological condition affecting over one billion people worldwide, causing significant disruption to daily life due to their severe symptoms.
•Accurately diagnosing migraine subtypes remains a challenge, as traditional methods often rely on subjective assessments that can lead to misdiagnosis. In response, our project focuses on utilizing TabNet, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm optimized for tabular data, to enhance the accuracy of migraine classification. 
•This study aims to develop an innovative system that leverages TabNet's advanced capabilities to aid healthcare professionals in distinguishing between different migraine subtypes.

Problem Statement:
•Migraines are complex and diverse in their presentation, often accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. 
•The wide variability in symptoms and the overlap between migraine subtypes make accurate diagnosis a challenging task.
•Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming and prone to errors due to their reliance on subjective assessments.
•This can lead to delayed or incorrect treatment, negatively impacting patient outcomes. There is an urgent need for a reliable and precise diagnostic system that can accurately classify migraine subtypes, enabling timely and effective treatment.

Proposed Solution:
Our proposed solution utilizes the TabNet algorithm, a cutting-edge deep learning model specifically designed for tabular data, to develop a robust system for classifying migraine subtypes. TabNet’s unique architecture, combining deep learning with decision trees through an attention mechanism, enables automatic learning of feature importance, reducing manual intervention. In addition to the classification system, we have created a comprehensive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Where users can access several key features:
•Symptom Checker: Users can input their symptoms to receive an accurate migraine subtype diagnosis based on our deep learning model.
•Educational Content: The website offers a wealth of information about migraines, helping users understand the condition better and explore treatment options.
•Blogs and Articles: Users can access a variety of blogs and articles that provide insights into migraine management, personal stories, and the latest research findings.
•Community Support: A dedicated support community is available, allowing users to connect with others, share experiences, and seek advice.
